# Markdown
This is a simple Markdown Editor web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the app, including a text area where users can type Markdown content and a preview section to display the formatted output. The CSS file (markdown.css) is used to design a clean two-column layout, style the text area and preview section, and make the interface easy to read and use. The JavaScript file (markdown.js) adds functionality by converting the typed Markdown text into formatted HTML in real time and displaying it in the preview section. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time content rendering in a simple and practical way.
